# farfallino-translator (Python Version)
Inspired from [Farfallino translator](https://github.com/flaviolivolsi/farfallino-translator/) developed by Flavio Li Volsi
in Node.JS language. I want to do the same but for Python :D

This module let you to encrypt your text using Farfallino Alphabet. In this way, you can easily speak also with your children.

If you want to know more about **Farfallino Aphabet**, you can go to [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farfallino_alphabet).

## Usage
```python
from farfallino import farfallino_transform

# Input: Hey Bob, how are you?
# Output: 'Hefeyfy Bofob, hofow afarefe yfyofoufu?' will be saved into new_text variable.
new_text = farfallino_transform("Hey Bob, how are you?")

# Input: Hey sweetie, I love you!
# Output: 'Hefeyfy swefeefetifiefe, IfI lofovefe yfyofoufu!' will be printed.
print(farfallino_transform("Hey sweetie, I love you!"))
```
